# Model Performance and Implementation Documentation

## Model Performance Evaluation

### Current Metrics and Measurements

1. Topic Assignment Evaluation
- Distribution of documents across topics with precise percentage tracking
- Measurement of single-topic assignments vs multiple-topic assignments
- Tracking of unassigned documents (those not fitting any topic)
- Basic accuracy assessment through probability scores

2. Quality Assessment
- Document distribution analysis across topics
- Coverage measurement (proportion of documents successfully categorized)
- Confidence scoring for topic assignments
- Default similarity threshold of 0.3 for reliable topic assignment

### Implementation Features

1. Data Processing
- Systematic embedding generation for all documents
- Topic extraction using the BERTopic framework
- Calculation of document-topic assignment probabilities
- Document-topic similarity scoring

2. Topic Management System
- Interactive topic label modification
- Keyword addition and removal functionality
- Integration of user guidance for topic refinement
- Feedback history tracking

## User Trust Features

### Topic Information Transparency

1. Visualization and Display
- Clear presentation of topic keywords
- Interactive topic distribution visualization
- Comprehensive model information display
- Export functionality for detailed analysis

2. Quality Assessment Tools
- Detailed topic distribution statistics
- Document assignment analysis
- Complete results export capability
- User feedback integration system

## Known Limitations

### Model Constraints
1. Basic Limitations
- Requires minimum topic size configuration
- Limited by sentence transformer model capabilities
- Single language model processing at a time
- Batch processing only (no real-time updates)

2. Processing Limitations
- Manual topic number selection required
- No automatic optimization of topic numbers
- Performance dependent on input data quality
- Batch processing limitations

## Data Storage and Privacy

### Current Data Management

1. Storage Implementation
- Local JSON storage for feedback data

- Basic file system utilization
- Local processing of all data

2. Data Access and Management
- File-based storage system
- Local processing architecture
- Basic session management
- Simple export functionality

### Security Considerations

1. Current Features
- Local data processing only
- Session-based data handling
- Basic file system security
- Structured data organization

2. Areas Needing Enhancement
- Data encryption implementation
- User authentication system
- Secure data deletion protocols
- Enhanced privacy controls

## Recommendations for Future Enhancement

### Security Improvements
1. Suggested Security Features
- Implementation of data encryption for stored feedback
- Addition of user authentication system
- Development of secure data deletion protocols
- Enhanced audit logging system

### Performance Optimization
1. Potential Enhancements
- Integration of parallel processing capabilities
- Development of efficient embedding storage
- Implementation of incremental topic updates
- Enhanced memory management system

Note: These recommendations are based on identified gaps in the current implementation and represent potential future development directions rather than existing features.
